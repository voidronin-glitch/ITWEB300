# Support Ticket System (OOP-Based)

This project is a simple web application that allows users to submit IT support tickets and search for existing tickets using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript.

##  How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/support-ticket-oop.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Fill out the form to submit a support ticket.
4. Use the search input to find existing tickets by name or ticket ID.

##  Notes
- All ticket data is stored in-memory in the browser (no backend integration).
- Server interaction is commented as placeholders for future implementation.

##  Author Experience
This project reinforced key OOP principles like encapsulation and separation of concerns. It was insightful to impliment a previous functional design into a class-based architecture.
